# ModCheck
Keep up to date with your legal speedrunning mods!  
If you are just starting out, you can use this to download all legal mods! Or, you can use this to keep up to date with all your mods by running this script periodically! I will be remotely updating the list of legal mods, so no need to download a new version of this program everytime.


Supports windows and minecraft version 1.16.1, though other support may come if people bug me for it.


Settings file is of yaml format.  
Under "directories", put all your .minecraft/mods folder paths each on new lines. Each line should look like  
"- C:\path\to\.minecraft\mods"  
Under "useMod" each legal mod will be listed and either "true" or "false". If you want to use/update a certain mod, flag it to true. Otherwise, flag it to false.


MAKE SURE to not leave any files you want to keep in your mods folder.  
ALL OTHER FILES IN MODS FOLDER WILL BE DELETED.  
The exception to this is the dynamic-fps mod, since there is no Github page for it and also no updates for it, so it will not be tracked.


For any issues, message me at meera#8941.
