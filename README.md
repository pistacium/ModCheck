# ModCheck
Keep up to date with your legal speedrunning mods!


Supports windows and minecraft version 1.16.1, though other support may come if people bug me for it.


Settings file is of yaml format.  
Under "directories", put all your .minecraft/mods folder paths each on new lines. Each line should look like "- C:\path\to\.minecraft\mods"  
Under "useMod" each legal mod will be listed and either "true" or "false". If you want to use/update a certain mod, flag it to true. Otherwise, flag it to false.


MAKE SURE to not leave any files you want to keep in your mods folder.  
ALL OTHER FILES IN MODS FOLDER WILL BE DELETED.  
The exception to this is the dynamic-fps mod, since there is no Github page for it and also no updates for it, so it will not be tracked.
